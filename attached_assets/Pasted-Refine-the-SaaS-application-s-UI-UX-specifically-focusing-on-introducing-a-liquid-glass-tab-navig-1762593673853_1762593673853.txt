Refine the SaaS application's UI/UX, specifically focusing on introducing a "liquid glass" tab navigation system for comparative metrics and organizing information neatly within these tabs. The design should appear professional, minimal, and original, strictly adhering to a black and white brand palette. Avoid any alterations to backend logic.

Key Design Principles:

Liquid Glass Tab Navigation: Implement a tab system similar to the provided example (Image 1 and 2), where the active tab has a distinct, smooth, and slightly translucent background effect that feels "liquid" or "frosted glass," setting it apart from inactive tabs.

Professional & Minimalist Aesthetic: Maintain clean lines, ample whitespace, and an uncluttered layout throughout. Every element should serve a clear purpose.

Originality: Avoid generic or "AI-generated" visual patterns. Strive for a unique but subtle design language.

Black & White Palette: Use only black and white, with varying shades of grey for depth and distinction. Avoid any other accent colors.

Specific Page Improvements:

1. Global Navigation/Header (Applying Image 2 Reference):

GeoPulse Logo and Branding: Keep the GeoPulse logo prominent.

Primary Navigation: Redesign the main navigation links (Features, Pricing, About, Login) to be clean, text-based, and aligned with the black/white theme. Inactive links should be a subtle grey, active/hover links black.

"Get Started" Button: Redesign the "Get Started" button using a solid black background with white text, adhering to a minimal, professional look. Ensure consistent corner radius with other interactive elements.

2. Tab System Implementation (Applying Image 1 Reference):

Main Navigation for Analysis Views:

Introduce a primary tab bar for navigating between the main sections of the analysis (e.g., "Overview," "Recommendations," "Score Breakdown," "Competitor Analysis," "Missing Elements").

Each tab should use the "liquid glass" style:

Inactive Tabs: White background with black text, or a very light grey background with black text.

Active Tab: A smooth, slightly translucent dark grey or black background with crisp white text, giving the "liquid glass" effect. The transition between active and inactive states should be fluid and visually appealing.

Ensure tabs have a consistent, generous padding and a rounded pill-shape.

3. Content Organization within Tabs (Revisiting Previous Content with New Tab Structure):

For "Recommendations" Tab (Content from original Image 1):

Place the "AI-Generated Recommendations" section within this tab.

Each recommendation card should be a clean, distinct block on a white background.

"HIGH," "MEDIUM" Labels: Redesign these to be very minimal. Use a small, filled black pill-shape for "HIGH" and a light grey outline for "MEDIUM" with corresponding black text. This provides visual distinction within the black & white palette.

Action Items: Use clear, simple bullet points (black dots) with ample line spacing.

"Estimated Impact": Present this information clearly with minimal styling.

For "Score Breakdown" Tab (Content from original Image 2):

Place the "Score Breakdown" radar chart and horizontal bars, along with the "Competitor Rankings" section, within this tab.

Radar Chart: Redesign for extreme minimalism. Use thin black lines for the grid and data plot. The fill should be a very light grey, almost translucent.

Breakdown Bars: Use a simple black bar against a light grey track for progress. Labels should be clean and aligned.

Competitor Rankings: Present each competitor within a clean, card-like structure on a white background.

Key Strengths: Use small black bullet points for each strength.

Score/Overlap: Clearly distinguish these numerical values with a slightly bolder font.

For "Overview" Tab (Content from original Image 3, and for initial view):

Place the "Overall Score," "Mention Rate," "Competitor Position," "Platform Average" cards here. Redesign them for ultimate minimalism, using varying shades of black/grey for text and subtle dividers.

The "Platform Visibility Scores" bar chart should also reside here.

Bar Chart: Redesign with clean black bars against a white background. The labels should be precise.

The "Missing Elements Detected" section should be a simple, well-structured list on a white background, using black text and minimal icons. For impact labels (e.g., "high impact"), use a subtle black or dark grey tag.

General UI Elements:

Icons: Ensure all icons are monochrome (black or dark grey on white), line-art style, and consistent in weight and size.

Borders & Dividers: Use thin, subtle grey lines for borders or dividers between sections or cards where necessary, rather than heavy boxes.

Hover States: Implement subtle hover effects (e.g., slight background change, text color change) for all interactive elements to enhance usability.

By following these guidelines, the application's UI will achieve a highly professional, minimal, and attractive look, leveraging the "liquid glass" tab style to organize complex data in an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing manner, all within your brand's strict black and white color scheme.

Here's an example of how the new design principles, particularly the tab navigation, could be applied to a section of your app
